# RL_pytorch_model
A personal playground of different RL models and algorithms 
The model is written in Pytorch, with utility functions and some framework borrowed from: [yandex](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)

## Requirements
Python: 3.6 or above 

Pytorch: 0.4.1 (CUDA)

Gym: most updated version

## Run
Just type 
```
python main.py
```
Hyperparameters and games can be changed in the `main.py` script. A graph showing rewards during training will be save in the current directory.

## Additional models to be added in the future
Curiosity (finished but not tuned)

Attention

Memory

and more...
